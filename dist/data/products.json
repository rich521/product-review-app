Sarah's talk at the beginning was so interesting and set the scene perfectly, it made me look at the garden from a completely different view point which at times is what is needed. I really hope that the National Trust encourage the new gardener to relax and soften up the garden. Meeting and listening to Adam was very much an added bonus as he brought another dimension to the evening in letting us peep into the lives of his relations. As for the food, well what I can say apart from it was the best meal I have had in ages! It was so fresh and wholesome and the taste was beyond superb. Thanks again to both Sarah and Adam and everyone behind the scenes on Thursday who gave up their time to give us such a thoroughly enjoyable time."

The meal we all shared in the restaurant was delicious and graciously served. A world away from National Trust meals.

As always with any catering provided by Perch Hill, the food was absolutely delicious, lovely combination of flavours, beautifully seasoned, seasonal and fresh and we felt well catered for. The Prosecco and canapés on arrival were a lovely touch (we once attended a champagne lunch at Gt Dixter many years ago hosted by Gardens Illustrated which was very poor and I had to complain about it – no such worries here!). Not only does Sarah know her stuff where gardens are concerned but she knows how to provide very good hospitality."

Now, in Nov, the plants are big and blousy with the most fantastic colouring. Can't wait to eat them as a cooked veg. Next year I'll sow another row, perhaps even more thinly, and definitely so I'll have even more winter veg."

We sowed half the packet in March ( or rather say chucked over the soil and drowned with a gallon of water) and by July had a few blooms. Over watering and slug attacks are not a good combination. Sowed the rest of the packets in July and by September had a gorgeous display. My oldest daughter was impressed it looked just like the picture! What is impressive that we were still picking flowers at Christmas, New Year and Valentines Day! Not bad for two packets of seeds. Although it is called the edible flower collection, my children wouldn't try them. Lol."

Depending on weather, I might leave the cloche on part of the row to stagger growth. I've been cutting the last sowing in August for 2/3 weeks now. Some plants have not been covered and lettuces are small, but very few have bolted. Even these are good to eat or make a lettuce and potato soup."

I really had a great time and have now decided to take up gardening as a hobby and have already written out my order form for seeds to plant. :) I felt I learnt a lot, even as a beginner, and I intend to make my garden a beautiful, tranquil place. My favourite part of the day was meeting Sarah's dog, who followed us around, he is absolutely gorgeous (as well as Fiona the cat!). Also, the food was very delicious. Very unusual and very yummy. All team members were very friendly and helpful. I love the Emma Bridgewater mugs, lots of tea and the homemade biscuits. We had a wonderful day and hope to attend another course next year."

The bees absolutely love these flowers as they are loaded full of pollen and I often had to shake off a fat lazy bee when I was picking them. They are a brilliant cut flower having a nice sturdy stem, and last really well, looking particularly good with dark dahlias and sunflowers."

The colours, particularly the Matucana are so sumptuous and the smell is out of this world. I've sown some more this spring and these plants are now out in the garden too so I'm hoping the flowers will keep on coming for months!"

Strong, healthy plants with vibrant colours. Dare I say that they have done better than bulbs from one of the famous tulip growers who charge very high prices. I followed the instructions according to the video on the website where Sarah shows you how to layer bulbs and also adds horticultural grit. It looks like loads of grit but chuck it all in and you will reap rewards. This has improved the performance of all my bulbs and our garden is having the best spring ever. I have used a palette of colours from Sarah's book, The Bold and Brilliant Garden and it works really well. Now feeling anxious about how I am going to repeat the performance through until autumn :-). Bravo!"

They are also tender-leaved, a big favourite of sawfly caterpillars, which have munched mine happily. Mme de Carrière is as susceptible to black spot and mildew as any other rose, in my opinion. Still a stunning flower, once it eventually gets going."

However they'd started to rally and looked like they were going to fulfill their potential when they then got snaffled by (we think) a mouse or other rodent. :o( However, the ones I grew from seed were healthy & strong so withstood the worst of the mousey attentions. Would therefore personally recommend growing them yourself if you have the facility rather than getting plugs."

I loved Adam's amusing and laid back account of his family's history and Sarah's informative talk on Vita's planting and what happened after her day. It was just like a personal trip with two friends! The delicious food in the restaurant afterwards was the icing on the cake. The couple's dogs were also definitely joint stars!"

We have noticed a very large increase in areas covered in wild flowers, from roundabouts to islands between dual carriageways. Many councils seemed to have taken up your idea, which is great to see. We ourselves we inspired by your programme and have planted 6 sq mtrs in our own small back garden. Tremendous colours, and doing a great job for the pollinating bees and butterflies."

	"comments": "I bought these along with the Pictorial Meadows Classic Annual Mix for an empty flower bed I hadn't got round to planting up. Instead of leaving it empty I thought I'd try and plant a mixture of annual seeds to provide colour and interest but also provide flowers that would be good for bees, butterflies and other insects. Located in Northern Aberdeenshire I didn't think the results would be like the pictures from the website but gave it a go anyway. Preparing the plot as suggested I scattered the seeds and waited. I am absolutely amazed at the results! I have so much colour and variety and the area is just buzzing with bees, hoverflies and various butterflies. Visitors to my garden are very complimentary with most comments 'Just stunning' - who could ask for more! Thankyou Sarah Raven for great, good quality seeds. I'll definitely be back for more to plant next year!"

Do not be tempted to grind up the barbeque charcoal as it is produced at a lower temperature and you are likely to poison your soil so make sure its genuine Bio char."

There are far to large and strong to be called Plugs or even large Plugs. They are very large strong plants; must confess to being more than dubious when I found them wrapped in Tissue Paper instead or the usual plastic containers used by other mail order companies. I have enjoyed reading your catalogues and now are used in place of 'coffee table books' I'm looking forward to seeing all of the bulbs appearing, how can anyone who sees a plant first appear and continue to full flower not believe in a Creator God? Thank you so much. Geoff"

All are worth the daily grind of taking a moment of inspecting them for lily beetle. First to bloom is Nerone opening the colour of the finest tomato soup then fading to a crimson. Landini is a delight being the summer version of the queen of the night tulip with its unbeatable dark petals and bright orange stamens. Last to bloom is the exotic species Rubrum this is the last lily to the summer party but worth waiting for. We garden in the north and grow all these lilies in pots - I set most of them in the autumn beneath my early tulips by the time the tulips are over the lilies are waking up beneath them so plug what would otherwise be an empty pot. All need staking!"

The built in timer is an excellent idea - they run for 6 hours from when you switch them on then go off for 18 - so ours are perfectly set for 4pm till 10pm. The reasons I have dropped a star is 1) they would have been better designed by the manufacturer if the cables came out the back, rather than the sides, this makes the wires impossible to hide (unless you cover them with say, tinsel) 2) when lit its hard to see that they are even owls at all (very subtle features) 3) the 'twinkle' setting is sadly rather frantic and rapid - so I am leaving them the continuous setting. All that said - highly recommendable."

There were 13 packets of seeds included in the pack together with growing instructions and a plan for the 'cutting patch'. A novice at this, I really enjoyed the whole process from beginning to end - sowing, potting on, planting out, tending the patch. But what I loved most of all was picking little posies for the house: through the long summer, I always had fresh flowers to dot around in vases - a real joy to pick them and make simple arrangements. These posies adorned my niece's wedding reception: placed in little jars they looked really pretty. Just one thing, Sarah: could we have pictures of the seedlings as they begin to grow and a little later on? My labelling left something to be desired and I want to improve that this year. Now I know what I am doing I will buy more of some flowers and fewer of others, and try some new varieties too. I have made a second cutting patch in preparation! This is a great starter kit for anyone setting out to grow simple, beautiful cut flowers in not too large a space."

I followed the most helpful instructions precisely, sowing my two packets of seed in the last week of April, in my beautifully prepared soil. I congratulated myself and waited for the flower meadow to sprout. Not a single plant appeared, In fact I was unable to spot not a single seedling, even with my glasses on! I am still extremely disappointed, it was going to be so lovely, and I waited a long time before I admitted defeat and planted winter brassicas instead. Will I try again? No, I shall just keep looking at the amazing pictures in the brochure, and thinking 'if only...'"

I started them off indoors and Thomas Edison gave me three splendid plants which started flowering in June and went on till November, giving loads of colour and plenty to cut for the house. It was always the one which visitors commented on first - amazing depth of colour and robust plants. Plants have to earn their place for me in Brittany, with a garden only 3 metres wide and 50 m long, sloping down to the river, and everything always 'on view'. The dahlias are in the lower 'fifth' and draw the eye down to tempt us away from the house - even though the walk back is a bit of an effort at 84! - and Thomas Edison certainly earns his place."

	"comments": "The photograph implies the relative sizes of the plants. This is not how it happened! I now assume cutting back the more vigorous osteospermum and cosmos is necessary to achieve that balance. It is now March 2015 and the oesteospermum in this collection have flowered continuously since the collection was planted last spring! I planted up two 32cm blue-glazed terracotta pots with two 9-plant collections and the display was stunning over the whole summer and autumn, looking good until October. Every visitor to our apartment commented on how stylish they looked on the balcony! The cosmos 'Sonata White' was the main attraction with its prolific saucers staring wide-eyed at you with their yellow irises but the whole effect was necessary. I now definitely recommend staking this collection and keeping the oestospermum in check. The phlox were the least successful - though that is being unkind - as they were bulllied out of the way by the cosmos and osteospermum, particularly suffering from not being adequately staked, flopping wildly. They lasted until October, nevertheless. The cosmos were a huge success even after mildrew arrived in September (probably my fault: watering may have been incorrect; fed every fortnight with high-potash liquid feed and I do not spray). I eventually cut them down in late October/November. The osteospermum have survived, unpruned, though leggy now, flowering continuously through the winter, though the flowers often failed to open completely in the cold. They are too leggy to keep unless I had the space to cut them back and replant elsewhere, as I'm going to try the pelargonium and convolvulus collection this year - and need to find somewhere to put more cosmos 'Sonata' as after this display, I cannot do without it!"

I also don't seem to have a problem with caterpillars - possibly because I actively encourage wasps into the garden? The flowers have the most gorgeous fragrance, and make sitting on the patio an absolute delight in summer and the autumn. I cannot recommend this rose highly enough."

	"comments": "My wife persuaded me that we should buy this collection. When they arrived we carefully selected three large pots and filled with the appropriate compost - a first for me as I usually use what I have to hand at the time! We planted on two levels in each pot to get a good show from each display. I have to say we have not been disappointed with the show, they really are a joy to us as we sit in the garden enjoying the current fine spell of weather. The colours are strong and vibrant and are not affected by the sun, which has bleached some other tulips we have in the garden. We will no doubt be purchasing some more later this year when supplies become available - an excellent purchase!"

I planted these quite late, in groups of three and this is their first year. They are only 8-10' tall at the moment, which to be honest is just perfect in our exposed location. I am so delighted, I will be ordering more this autumn. I have never seen these anywhere else before, so many thanks Sarah Raven!"

I let my first sowing of it go to seed in the polytunnel about 10 years ago, and never had to sow it again (to the extent that I consider it a weed sometimes!) I keep one or two plants and harvest leaves all year round. It doesn't need much water, and it does very well in dry rocky soil too. Here (SW Ireland) can be grown as annual outdoors, as it doesn't seem to like wet winters."

Well, out of the 80 bulbs that I purchased, only 43 have flowered. Just like the 1998 World Cup final, Ronaldo is a total no-show. Of the other team players, they came on late and have barely made it to half time. The chances of them lasting til full time are looking pretty slim. I know it's been a topsy-turvy Spring, so I am putting this down to experience and am now pinning my hopes on Menton, that I bought and planted at the same time."

	"comments": "At first sight this is a charming little euphorbia, which I added to my dry garden on chalk some years ago. Appearances are deceptive: it is a thug! Spreads like the pox. Has invaded the lawn. These tendencies are fine in rougher, more inhospitable areas where it runs happily among other scrambling and low growing tough characters and makes a fine show in spring with attractive red new growth and bright lime green flowers. For a brief moment I almost love it, until I see a multiplicity of shoots encroaching on more polite and treasured plants. It is possible only to deter its ambitions - the roots are deep and pervasive. Therefore I'm issuing this warning to the unwary - if you can't resist Fens Ruby, be VERY careful where you plant her. Manage her vigilantly. Surprised Sarah Raven has not included some sort of alert for potential buyers. (Buyers! Please come and take some from my garden free of charge.)"

It's not totally resistant to blackspot, but otherwise and in a non-chemical garden, it has shown great stamina! I thoroughly recommend!"

The palette of colours is just breathtaking.. So delightful the way the blue tufted vetch climbs through the daisies and sorrel, punctuated by the charming purples of knapweed and selfheal, and softened by the pale yellows of lady's bedstraw, birds foot trefoil and toadflax.. I am so pleased with our front garden meadow that I have just bought the exact same mix to sow a meadow in the back garden. All I would add is to remind other users to be patient - ours took over a year before it really flowered properly. Second time round I will definitely sow in the autumn as opposed to the spring, in order to give new roots longer to establish. It was worth the wait! All is now out in full colour, wowing passers-by, and I get the sense that next year even more species will be out.. It is buzzing with bees and insects. Superb! Thank you Sarah for your artistic genius, once again. Please never stop doing this mix."

I have it planted near Heuchera Georgia Peach and the colour of these lilies is picked up perfectly in the Heuchera foliage. I also have sedum planted in between and the pale green of the flowers in bud set both off beautifully. I've only knocked a star off because the height and colour aren't quite what I expected."

Contrary to the advice here, as seedlings in the cold frame I found them very thirsty - now they get a can when I remember but are otherwise watered by two upturned wine bottles fitted with plastic 'drip' spikes stuck in the ground. I expect to be cutting flowers from them for weeks. Obviously our very dry & hot summer is suiting them!"

It's a bit more expensive than some bulbs, but well worth the extra - and the colour is gorgeous."

I rushed home ordered loads more plants on line, Adam's lyrical, sometimes painful book on Sissinghurst (read before you go if possible) another of Sarah's Cookbooks and I am still inspired.

What can I say, except that these have been the biggest and most awesome flowers I have ever grown. They are huge and prolific and they last so long even when cut with my blunt scissors, I've actually had to throw some away! A slight word of warning: they do attract blackflies with their 'sticky' leaves, so be prepared to pick them off, and they spread massively, so make sure to give them enough room to do their thing! If you're only planting them in a big swathe, 30cm is fine, but if they're next to something else, give them more like 50cm or they can swamp neighbouring seedlings."

The whole team involved made us feel very welcome, nothing was rushed or too much trouble. The gardens themselves need no recommendation, but exploring them in a new light, in context, was fascinating. I would love to take part again."

	"comments": "It is hard to find a vase suitable for small flowers such as primroses which make such good cut flowers. I wanted this vase as soon as I saw it in the catalogue but I thought it was too expensive to buy. A few months later (persuaded by a discount) I bought the vase. I am so glad I did. It is great for the short stems I pull off taller stems because they would be under the waterline. Its shape and weight make it ideal for the table next to my chair as it is not so easy to knock over."

Needing no dead-heading or attention apart from the very occasional drop of water in my thin and chalky soil they have bloomed non-stop and show no sign of stopping. Will definitely grow these next year. I also have loads of snails and they have not been troubled."

The only drawback seems to be the size, they are growing to an unusual 10-12 feet tall. The foliage is huge and I sprinkle live mealworms onto the foliage which encourages a multitude of birds and they feed on other insects too. So a win win all round."

These are an elegant compromise: I love them......I'm just hoping that the tin bowls are awarded a similar discount for multiple purchases and that range expands too........Sarah?"

The pace of the day is good - there's a good balance between talks and demonstrations. It's very helpful to know which varieties of veg do well and it's extraordinary useful to know what not to grow. Lunch -grown from the Perch Hill garden - is delicious, and the pots and plantings all around are inspiring. Equally good for beginners as well as more experienced gardeners who want to sharpen up their veg skills."

The Shirleys are smaller and shorter than the Sapporo, although a very lovely colour. The Sapporo are more spectacular which surprised me as in the picture here they looked rather narrow and spikey. But they really are impressive and somewhat grab the limelight from the more delicate Shirley. A lovely colour mix and very easy to grow. I would recommend this collection."

	"comments": "This collection started to flower late April and by early May looked fantastic planted up in a couple of old vintage galvanised baths. (Approx 70x40cm with drainage holes drilled into the bottom). The Belle Epoque is a fabulous tulip - the description on its page here is spot on: very unusual, a wonderful coffee colour and it has lasted really well - slowly becoming more blowsy which is why I've said there is a feeling of faded grandeur about the collection! It is very snazzy - close up shots taken with an old iphone 4 look fab. It has taken a hammering in the rain, but The Graceland tulip itself is beautiful - more interesting than it looks on the site, as is the Apricot Beauty: wonderful markings both. I was told by friends that Sarah Raven tulips flower later than other brands and I found this to be true. Worth the wait however, and I'd layered Muscari and Narcissi in the tubs with the tulips (the SR video on 'lasagnes' is vg) so have had a display in the tubs since later February. The foliage from the earlier plants has also added to the abundance so the 30 bulb collection has been enough for the 2 old tubs. A gorgeous, vintagey collection and an easy way to impress visitors!"

Soft, beautiful colours, and much bigger flowers than I expected. The bonus is the gorgeous 'Purple Tower', which was green when the tulips were out, and has slowly turned into a purple-topped wonder, which looks amazing with the alliums that followed on!"

The blue bracts are very unusual, and, whilst it is not exactly clump-forming in itself, three or four plants together create a beautiful, spreading clump of blue and green, perfect for the edge of raised beds. It is ideal for filling gaps and lending softness against the rigidity of taller, more upright plants. All this, and hardly a nibble from our mollusc friends!"

Talk about easy gardening, though I understand I'll have to prune in spring. My soil is very free-draining, I added a bit of manure. It has been in flower for at least three days, I spotted it from a distance and thought it was forget-me-not but up close it's lovely, sky blue with hints of violet. It sort of reminds me of the Mediterranean, or maybe it's just the weather, I hope it likes it when we're having a more British summer. It has delicate bells and a semi-wild look I prefer. It's part of a bed I have to fill up opposite the bedroom windows and I want in restful purples, graduating from blue to reddish. I think having this success will give me the motivation to tidy it up and do some more planting. The blackbird penstemons aren't out yet, they are a bit more exposed to easterly/north winds in their position. I'll be delighted if they last through the autumn and come back year after year. £6.50 well spent I'd say!"

They grew on beautifully and once their roots had filled the pots, they went into the border and are flowering brilliantly. This is an ideal way for me to grow a small number of different annuals - I don't really enjoy growing from seed myself (quelle horreur!) and I shall certainly be ordering more plugs next year if these are anything to go by!"

The tuber was planted with 14 other tubers early March and is one of the first to flower with Gerrie Hoek. Both plants are strong and healthy and are bigger than the cheaper tubers I purchased from elsewhere."

We are in Scotland so maybe this is April elsewhere ;) Completely delighted to find that pretty much all the seed I sowed direct outdoors has now sprouted into pretty lime green plants along my borders."

We went last week and it was every bit as wonderful as I hoped it would be. I have visited Sissinghurst several times and love it. However the evening was wonderfully balmy after a very hot day. The group sat on the tower steps whilst Juliet and Adam told stories of Sissinghurst, of Vita and Harold, then Sarah joined in with a chat about the planting as Vita and Harold had jointly imagined. What a fabulous pairing they were for the garden and what vision. Sarah, Juliet and Adam made us feel very welcome and the whole atmosphere was informal and fun and absolutely riveting. We wandered around the garden, the tower and the south cottage at our leisure and what a gift to see the garden with so few people in it. Utterly captivating. Dinner was delicious- 3 fresh courses of wonderful food then we wandered back out into the white garden to see it in the moonlight. I cannot ever overestimate how lovely and special this evening was and urge you to go yourself. My mum and friend were overwhelmed with the sheer loveliness of the evening and I think you will be too. Incidentally- I bought Juliette's book ' A houseful of daughters' which I have read already since last week and can recommend it. I also bought Sarah's 'Good Good food' book and have already cooked several recipes all of which are equally delicious as our meal last week. What can I say? I'm a fan of all things Sissinghurst - please - go and see for yourself."

The calyx remains on the plant, and so as new flowers arrive the plant is ever covered in bloom, growing bigger and more exotic looking, nothing much like a salvia. The leaves are refined in appearance. Caution with slugs when the plant is young."

The fuscias took over the baskets a bit! And the buddleia alone with just greenery will look glorious, with nothing to detract from the wonderful flowers produced. Will pot them out of the baskets before the weather gets too cold and put in a sheltered spot ready to plant up next year. They really are super plants."

The Pelargonium leaves smell of expensive soap when crushed but be aware, the plants tend to spread a lot so they need quite a bit of space around. e Anagalis did not trail in my boxes, in fact it grew the tallest of the three so plant it at the back."

They look wonderful infront of an Acer Purpureum for contrast and thread beautifully through verbena bonariensis. Will plant again next year."

Lovely soft creamy colour and a great cut flower. Small enough flowers to thread beautifully thorough other plants. Highly recommended."

The elasticated back means they fit the hand snuggly and close to the fingers so you can feel exactly what you are doing and they wash well. Well worth the money."

By accident I planted them in a border with pale purple and cream/pale yellow flowers and it has beautiful until this week when we had a hard frost. I will definitely grow them again."
